    Annotate tokens with entries from the dictionary.

    The algorithm works as follows:
    1.  The input token stream is grouped into contiguous "word chunks"
        (formed by concatenating adjacent word-like tokens) and "separator chunks".
    2.  It then iterates through every possible sequence of word chunks, treating
        each as a potential match against the dictionary phrases stored in the Trie.
    3.  For each valid match found in the Trie, all original tokens that form
        the match (including the word chunks and the separators between them)
        are annotated with the corresponding dictionary entry ID.
    4.  This approach handles simple words, compound phrases, overlapping matches,
        and nested phrases correctly and efficiently.

    Parameters:
        dictionary_index:   A dictionary index created by build_dictionary_index().
        tokens:             The tokens to be annotated.
